# CVRP-Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm
使用模拟退火算法求解经典CVRP问题

问题描述：
问题规模100个商店，8辆车从仓库出发完成配送后返回仓库，车辆容量约束为200，仓库和商店坐标和需求如Data.xlsx。求解最短的行驶距离~~

result.txt文件中给出一条最优路径，在当前坐标和容量的条件下求解出最短距离为833，且已知最优距离为826.x，说明该程序求解的结果较为靠近最优解

Classical CVRP problem solving using simulated annealing algorithm based python environment.
Problem description:
There are 100 stores with coordinates and quantity demanded, the 8 vehicles used for delivery return initial warehouse after finishing delivery. All vehicles capacity constraint is 200, warehouse and store coordinates and requirements are in Data.xlsx.

The result.txt file gives an optimal path, and the shortest distance is 833 under condition of current coordinates and capacity, and the optimal distance is known as 826.x, which means that the result of this program is closer to the optimal solution.

result.png is a visualization of the optimal path.
