# CVRP-Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm

Classical CVRP problem solving using simulated annealing algorithm based python environment.
Problem description:
There are 100 stores with coordinates and quantity demanded, the 8 vehicles used for delivery return initial warehouse after finishing delivery. All vehicles capacity constraint is 200, warehouse and store coordinates and requirements are in Data.xlsx.

The result.txt file gives an optimal path, and the shortest distance is 833 under condition of current coordinates and capacity, and the optimal distance is known as 826.x, which means that the result of this program is closer to the optimal solution.

result.png is a visualization of the optimal path.
